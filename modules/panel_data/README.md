# Module Description

**Main Goal**: To supplement and modify the information contained in the address books where necessary, so it can be used for sociological research.

## Specific Tasks

### General
- Make a panel dataset containing persons per year
- Present information that is not immediately recognizable from the 'raw' address books (e.g. the gender of a person)

### Names
  - Separation of first and last names
  - Separation of husband's and wife's last-names
  - Standardization of first names (e.g. Elis. -> Elisabeth)
  
### Job
  - Standardization
  - Classification
  
### Information Expansion
  - Gender recognition
      - For a person with a name like 'E. Müller', it is not clear whether it is a man (e.g. 'Emil') or a woman (e.g. 'Elisabeth').
    Since knowing the exact gender of the persons is of utmost importance for sociological research, we will try to determine the person gender using various methods, such as:
      - classifying jobs into jobs that are typically done by men/women
      - searching for keywords like 'widow'
      - ...
  - Separation of husband and wife
    - In earlier books the wife is only appended to the husband's name, e.g. 'Müller-Bachmann Rudolf', where "Bachmann" is the wife's name. In order to create the panel dataset, we need to separate the names and create a new entry for the wife
